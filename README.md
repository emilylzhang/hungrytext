# hungrytext
Replies to a text to the number [(669) 600-5660] containing your current location with a text containing the location of the nearest In-N-Out, as well as directions to this location. Built using heroku and twilio. Uses Google and Yelp API's.

(Only works for phone numbers that have been registered to twilio.)

**Update: Unfortunately, as my twilio trial has expired, texts to [(669) 600-5660] no longer work. However, hungrytext.herokuapp.com is still up. If you make a POST request to the server at hungrytext.herokuapp.com, you probably won't get a response back with the direction/location of the nearest In-N-Out because I've only implemented a response for texting, but I'll probably come back and fix this later when I have time.**
